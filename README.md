# TidyFactor HTMX

The **HTMX track** of the TidyFactor skill library — a Claude skill for
the hypermedia interaction layer: htmx over server-rendered fragments,
vendored locally with no CDN dependency.

This is a **layer, not a full stack**. It owns how fragments get
requested, swapped, validated, and made navigable — not backend
architecture or data. It pairs with `tidyfactor-php` or
`tidyfactor-php-micro` (or any other server that can render HTML),
rather than replacing them.

## Three lifecycle modes
- **Init** — add the htmx layer to a project (new or existing backend).
- **Convert** — replace ad hoc `fetch()`/full-page-reload interactivity
  with htmx.
- **Improve** — audit and fix an existing htmx implementation.

## Command set
`init` · `assets` · `fragments` · `swap` · `triggers` · `forms` ·
`indicators` · `history` · `modules` · `i18n` — see `SKILL.md` for full
sequencing and each command's reference file under
`references/commands/`.

## Related skills
Part of the TidyFactor skill library — see `tidyfactor-html` (no
backend), `tidyfactor-php` (vanilla backend), `tidyfactor-php-micro`
(opinionated Flight+Medoo+Plates backend), and the planned
`tidyfactor-js` / `tidyfactor-js-micro` tracks.
